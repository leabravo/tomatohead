## Synopsis

Tomatohead is a basic Pomodoro timer using the header line for visual feedback of the time elapsed in the current timer.

## Feature List

This project was started as a way of learning the basic Emacs building blocks as well as some Lisp and although the basic functionality is there, there's still plenty of room for improvement. Here are the items which would make the mode great:

- [x] Basic 25/5/15 work/break/lgbreak Timer.
- [x] Long break.
- [x] Number of iterations before long break (4 Pomodoros default).
- [ ] Customizable timers.
- [ ] 100% refactored and consistent code.

## Motivation

Avoiding having another app running in the desktop/mobile/tablet/ISS and just focusing on the editor and having the satisfaction of seeing the progress in the timer.
